      " deep learning is a subfield of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high level abstractions in data. These models explore data by using structured levels of abstraction that extract higher level features from lower level features. Deep learning proposes that this process can be repeated several times to introduce increasingly higher level abstractions. Typical deep learning models are non-linear and composed of multiple processing layers. The learning process for this kind of model is similar to the way people learn: by continually reducing errors made in previous stages, and moving the model closer to an accurate representation of the data.\n",
      "The term deep learning refers to the length of such a computational model, which reproduces the brain's behavior, with the number of layers of non-linear transformation being the main physical feature of it. In practice, the feature extraction aspect of such models is generally not discussed or reviewed. Deep learning models are constructed in a layered structure, which is inspired by the neurons in the brain. Deep learning models are based on a hierarchical structure, where deeper layers learn more abstract features, such as shapes and edges, than the ones present in the lower level. There are models that can learn at the higher level and models that have been trained to learn at the lower level.\n",
